			<h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p>Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. His father was a local politician and his mother was a devout Hindu. He studied law in London and became a barrister in 1891.
                Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.

			<h2>Philosophy</h2>
			<p>Gandhi developed a philosophy of nonviolent resistance, which he called satyagraha. He believed that individuals could fight injustice and oppression through peaceful means, such as civil disobedience and boycotts.
                Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India.[10] In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire[10] was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan.[11] As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these, begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78,[12][13][14][15] also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan,[16][17][18][19] which the Indian government[20] had been resisting.[21][22][23][24][25] Although the Government of India relented,[26] as did the religious rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, spread among some Hindus in India.[27][28][15] Among these was Nathuram Godse,[29] a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western India,[30][31] who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.[32][33][34][35]

			<h2>Tribute</h2>
			<p>Gandhi's influence extended far beyond India. His philosophy of nonviolence inspired leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. He is remembered as a champion of human rights and a symbol of peaceful resistance.
                Gandhi was great Indian nationalist, but at the same time he was a leader of international stature. His teachings and actions have left a deep impression on millions of people. As a teacher and leader, his influence made itself felt not only in India, but everywhere in the world and his death brings great sorrow to all peace loving people. Another giant among men has fallen in the cause of brotherhood and peace. I know that the people of Asia will be inspired by his tragic death to strive with increased determination to achieve the goals of cooperation and mutual trust for which the Mahatma has now given his life.
